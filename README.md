**Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews** 🍽️📝

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using natural language processing techniques. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in reviews, we can gain insights into customer opinions and preferences, which can be valuable for restaurant owners and managers in improving their services and offerings. 📊💬

## Features 🛠️

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes machine learning and NLP algorithms to classify the sentiment of restaurant reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis.

- **Model Training**: Trains and evaluates various machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Recurrent Neural Networks to identify the most effective approach for sentiment classification.

- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of sentiment distribution, word clouds, and sentiment trends over time to aid in understanding and interpretation of the results. 📈🔍

## Usage 🚀

1. **Data Collection**: Gather restaurant reviews from relevant sources such as review websites or APIs.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the raw text data by removing noise, tokenizing, and converting text into numerical features.

3. **Model Training**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the prepared data.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to classify the sentiment of new restaurant reviews in real-time.
